MEDIC is a product that enables indidividuals to receive remote medical attention. It consists of three parts: 

- A medical multitool that allows collection of vital statistics
- An Android App for the patient that transmits the collected vitals

The medical multitool connects to the patient's Android device over Bluetooth, and the collected data is then sent to the doctor over any available internet connection.
